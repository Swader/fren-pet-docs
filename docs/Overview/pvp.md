# Player Vs Player (PVP)

You can battle, hibernate and kill oher pets to earn, Poiints, ETH or stars.


## Battles

Every 30 minutes you can attack a pet that is above your level and that hasn't been bonked for 1 hour. <!--If you don't see anyone to bonk it's because they have all been bonked within the last hour. -->
The bonk winner gets 0.5% of the loser score and score directly effects ETH rewards


### Defense and Attack Score

Every pet starts with 10 AP (Attack Points) and 10 DP (Defense Points).

Every 1000 points you earn by upgrading your pet you get to spin a gatcha machine that will reward you with APs or DPs.

Here is the formula to decide your win probability: `(Attacker’s AP) / (Attacker’s AP + Defender’s DP)`



## Hibernation

If you forget to feed your pet, other players can send it to hibernation and get rewarded with a star, hibernation is a period of 7 days where you have a second chance to revive your pet.


### How it works

- While hibernating, if attacked by other players, your pet can lose 1% of its points (compared to 0.5% for active pets) and odds are 50-50 instead of 60-40. 
- Players have a 7-day window to feed their pet and bring it back to life. After that, pet can be killed by other players losing its score.
- To reactivate a hibernating pet, the first mushroom cost an additional 10 FP.
- If a pet dies after the 7-day hibernation period, owned shop items are automatically sold back to the shop. FP value and ETH rewards are transferred to the player's wallet.



## Kills

When a pet's TOD (time of death) reaches 0 you can kill it, burn the NFT onchain and earn a star, stars are very hard to get by.

You can check how many stars you've gained in the achievements page.
