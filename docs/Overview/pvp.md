# Player Vs Player (PVP)

You can battle, hibernate and kill other pets to earn ETH or stars.


## Battles

Every 30 minutes you can bonk a pet that is above your level and that hasn't been bonked for 1 hour. <!--If you don't see anyone to bonk it's because they have all been bonked within the last hour. -->

You have a 40% chance of winning the bonk, while your opponent with a higher level has a 60% chance of winning.

The bonk winner gets 0.5% of the losers score, which directly affects ETH rewards.

## Hibernation

If you forget to feed your pet, other players can send it to hibernation and get rewarded with a star. Hibernation is a period of 7 days where you have a second chance to revive your pet.


### How it works

- While hibernating, if attacked by other players, your pet can lose 1% of its points (compared to 0.5% for active pets) and odds are 50-50 instead of 60-40. 
- Players have a 7-day window to feed their pet and bring it back to life. After that,the pet can be killed by other players losing its score.
- To revive a hibernating pet, the first mushroom cost an additional 10 $FP.
- If a pet dies after the 7-day hibernation period, owned shop items are automatically sold back to the shop. $FP value and ETH rewards are transferred to the player's wallet.



## Kills

When a pet's TOD (Time Of Death) reaches 0 you can kill it, burn the NFT onchain and earn a star, and stars are very hard to get by.

You can check how many stars you've gained in the achievements page.
