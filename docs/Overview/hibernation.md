# Hibernation

If you forget to feed your pet, other players can send it to hibernation, a period of 7 days where you do not lose your points or items and can feed your pet again to return to the game.

## How it works

- While hibernating, if attacked by other players, the pet can lose 1% of its points (compared to 0.5% for active pets) and odds are 50-50 instead of 60-40. 
- Players have a 7-day window to feed their pet and bring it back to life. After that, pet can be killed by other players losing its score.
- To reactivate a hibernating pet, the first meal cost includes the regular price plus an additional 10 FP.
- If a pet dies after the 7-day hibernation period, owned shop items are automatically sold back to the shop. FP value and ETH rewards are transferred to the player's wallet.
