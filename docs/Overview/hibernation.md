# Hibernation

## Introduction of Hibernation Mode

Previously, the game allowed players to use a 'kill' button to eliminate another player's pet. This action resulted in the burning of the NFT, transfer of accumulated ETH rewards to the player's wallet, loss of all items bought in the shop, and reset of the player's points. While this feature added excitement to the game, it also led to frustration among many players who felt discouraged, often choosing not to return to the game.

## New Feature: Hibernation
To improve player experience and retention, we've introduced the "Hibernation" feature. When the Time of Death (TOD) timer reaches zero players see a "ZzZ..." button and can now put a pet into hibernation mode. Here's what happens:

- **Point Preservation:** The pet retains its points temporarily instead of losing them immediately.
- **Increased Vulnerability:** While hibernating, if attacked by other players, the pet loses 1% of its points (compared to 0.5% for active pets).
- **Item Safety:** Pets in hibernation do not lose their shop items.
- **Hibernation Period:** Players have a 7-day window to feed their pet and bring it back to life. Failing to do so leaves the pet vulnerable to being killed after this period.
- **Reactivation Cost:** To reactivate a hibernating pet, the first meal cost includes the regular price plus an additional 10 FP.
- **Post-Hibernation Death:** If a pet dies after the 7-day hibernation period, its shop items are automatically sold back to the shop, and the FP value, along with any accrued ETH rewards, is transferred to the player's wallet.
