# Initial Fren Pet Distribution 

100% of the FP tokens where distributed via a baseSwap pool with an initial buy limit of ~$0.80 cents per player, any player could get a maximum of 5000 $FP tokens to mint a pet and play the game

The team didn't pre-receive any tokens, all tokens they own (if any) were acquired via the pool.

All $FP used in the game is 100% burned.
