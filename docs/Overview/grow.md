# Grow Your Pet

Minting a Fren Pet is Free, when you join the app you'll get a randomly generated pet and can start playing right away.

Take care of your pet and keep it alive, on your pet page you will see a mushroom that will give your pet a "TOD" (Time Of Death) of 3 days. 

Time Of Death (TOD) is when your pet will die if it's not fed, if your pet dies your NFT is sent to hibernation (read more below).

If your pet is not fed during the hibernation period it will be burned and you can't revivie it or use it again.

You buy shrooms by paying in $FP Tokens that are burned.


**Note that your TOD (Time Of Death) never adds up, each new food you give your pet resets the TOD to 3 days**
