# Raise Your Pet

Minting a Fren Pet is Free. When you join the app you'll get a randomly generated pet and can start playing right away.

Take care of your pet and keep it alive. On your pet page you will see a mushroom, that once fed, will give your pet a "Time Of Death" (TOD for short) of 3 days. 

Time Of Death (TOD) is when your pet will die if it's not fed. If your pet dies your NFT is sent to hibernation (read more below).

If your pet is not fed during the hibernation period it will be burned and you can't revive it or use it again.

You buy shrooms by paying in $FP Tokens that are burned.


# Hibernation

If you forget to feed your pet, other players can send it to hibernation and get rewarded with a star. Hibernation is a period of 7 days where you do not lose your pet or items, but have limited ability to interact with the game until you feed your pet again to return to the game.

### How it works

- While hibernating, if attacked by other players, the pet can lose 1% of its points (compared to 0.5% for active pets) and odds are 50-50 instead of 60-40. 
- Players have a 7-day window to feed their pet and bring it back to life. After that, pet can be killed by other players losing its score.
- To reactivate a hibernating pet, the first shroom costs an additional 10 FP.
- If a pet dies after the 7-day hibernation period, owned shop items are automatically sold back to the shop. $FP value and ETH rewards are transferred to the player's wallet.



**Note that your TOD (Time Of Death) never adds up, each new shroom you give your pet resets the TOD to 3 days**
