# How To Play Fren Pet

Fren pet is an indie game on the base blockchain developed by [@caduveloso](https://twitter.com/cadu_veloso) and [@surfcoderepeat](https://twitter.com/surfcoderepeat).

## Download the app

You can download the mobile app on [frenpet.xyz](https://frenpet.xyz), it will create a crypto wallet for you and you will need to send in some ETH on the base network to get started.

## Minting a pet

You can mint a Fren Pet on the app, the minting is a dutch auction that runs for 10 minutes, it starts at 2000 $FP and goes down slowly until it reaches 100 $FP on the 10th minute.

Anyone can mint a pet at any point of the dutch auction, once a pet is minted a new dutch auction automatically starts.

This process helps find the fair market valued price for a pet at all times based on demand.

All tokens used to mint a pet are burned.
