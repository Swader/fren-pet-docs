# First pGold Airdrop

We are excited to announce the successful completion of our first pGold airdrop last Friday. This event marks the beginning of a series of airdrops scheduled to occur every Friday for the next three months.
The pGold airdrop is a mechanism to acknowledge and reward a variety of in-game activities and player engagements. It takes into account multiple aspects of gameplay, ensuring that active and dedicated players are rewarded for their efforts.
