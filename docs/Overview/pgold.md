# Earn pGold

On top of distributing ETH fees to players, every $FP used to mint pets goes to a [players treasure](https://basescan.org/token/0xff0c532fdb8cd566ae169c1cb157ff2bdc83e105?a=0x038d3417508aecf2889f79ebff61b32564282534) to be distributed to active players at a later date.

We created an on-chain in-game coin called $pGOLD to keep track of the shares of each player from the players treasure, based on pet score.

A total of 10_000_000 $pGOLD will ever exist.

You can earn $pGOLD by advancing in the Fren Pet World. You'll also need $pGOLD for things and activity within the game.

You can freely exchange $pGOLD to $FP, or get more $pGOLD with $FP via the app.
