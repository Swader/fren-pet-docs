# pGold

On top of distributing ETH fees to players, every $FP used to mint pets goes to a [players treasure](https://basescan.org/token/0xff0c532fdb8cd566ae169c1cb157ff2bdc83e105?a=0x038d3417508aecf2889f79ebff61b32564282534) to be distributed to active players at a later date.

We created an on-chain non tradeable point system called $pGOLD to keep track of the shares of each player on the players treasure.

A total of 10_000_000 pGOLD will be distributed in the first 3 months, the distribution will happen every Friday.


### A few things to note:

1. The pGOLD balance is per pet and it gets burned when your pet dies.
1. There is not a set date of when the community treasury will be distributed, we expect FrenPet to grow first.
1. Owning too many pets becomes more complex as the game grows so do it at your own risk.
1. The distribution algorithm can change without previous warning.

We reserve the right to reward with pGOLD pets of community members that help, build or spread positivity around FrenPet. Weâ€™ll share publicly if we decide to reward someone.
