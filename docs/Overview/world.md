# Fren Pet World (Quests)


Every 45 wins via battles you can advance in the World to the next adventure, once you solve an adventure you get a random piece of a larger puzzle you have to create.

Once you finish all levels you should 
Explore the vast Fren Pet World to battle the monsters and collect them as rare Fren Pets if you are lucky enough to win.


### How it works

1. Look out for pets on the map and make sure their stats suit you current level so you get decent odds.
1. Every 40 wins in battles against other pets, you get a chance against a monster in the Fren Pet World.
1. If you win, you get that monster (erc1155 nft).
1. If you lose, you need to win 10 more battles against regular pets for another chance.
1. When you win against monsters you get gold, points, and the monster NFT which is rare and limited based on mechanics of the game.
1. Monsters will likely be able to be exchanged/traded in the future (TO-DO).

[!IMPORTANT]
While the rest of the in-app games are settled via fair on-chain commit/reveal RNG, advancement in Fren Pet World uses the following on-chain function `winProbability = (attackPoints * 100) / (attackPoints + defensePoints)` , which makes [Gatcha Machine](docs/Overview/pve.md) core engine for advancement in the Fren Pet World.
