# Fren Pet Rewards System

There is a 5% tax every time someone buys or sells $FP tokens on BaseSwap. Once the smart contract accrues 1000 $FP tokens from taxes, they get automatically swapped into ETH and distributed as follows:

1. 2% goes to the players of the game as rewards.
1. 2% goes to the developers of Fren Pet.
1. 1% gets added back as liquidity provision to support the $FP economy.

The player rewards are distributed according to your share of in-game score share in relation to the total scores of all pets in the game.


**Note: Rewards work by working directly with a uniV2 contract, we reserve the right to block any uniV3 pools created as they would harm the players of the game. If you got tokens stuck in a uniV3 pool, contact us to help you.**



**Note:** When you claim your rewards in the app your score resets to 0 and your pet level starts from scratch, strategize accordingly.

## In-game usage and referrals

All $FP tokens used within the game are 90% burned and 10% sent to referrals.




# Burn $FP

The $FP used to buy mushrooms and keep your pet alive is 100% burned. So far over 25% (or 2.5mill $FP) of the max supply has been burned by players.

Fren Pet does no guarantee or make any promises about the future value or performance of the token, and the value of the token may fluctuate significantly.
