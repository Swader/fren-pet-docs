# FrenPet Rewards System

There is a 5% tax every time someones buys or sells $FP tokens on BaseSwap, once the smart contracts accrues 1000 $FP tokens from the taxes, they get automatically swapped into ETH and distributed as follows:

1. 2% goes to the players of the game as rewards.
1. 2% goes to the developers of Fren Pet
1. 1% gets added back as liquidity provision to support the FP economy

The player rewards are distributed according to your share of in-game score share in relation to the total scores of all pets in the game.


**Note: rewards work by working directly with a uniV2 contract, we reserve the right to block any v3 pools created as they would harm the players of the game. If you got tokens stuck in a v3 pool, contact us to help you.**



**Note:** when you claim rewards on the app your score resets to 0 and your pet level starts from scratch, strategize accordingly.

## In-game usage and referrals

All $FP tokens used within the game are 90% burned and 10% sent to referals.
