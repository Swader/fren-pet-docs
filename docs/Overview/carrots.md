# Introduction of "Carrots"

## Boosting Player Engagement with Carrots Rewards

In our idle game, constant player engagement and rewards are crucial. To enhance the reward frequency and player involvement, we're introducing 'Carrots' â€“ a new way to earn in-game. Here's how it works:

- **Constant Earning:** Each pet automatically generates carrots every second, ensuring players are continuously earning.
- **Conversion to pGold:** These carrots can be exchanged for pGold tokens. pGold represents a share of a significant treasure (currently over 100k FP tokens in players Treasure).
- **Treasure Sharing:** The treasure pot increases with more players joining, enhancing the rewards pool.
- **Upgrades System:** Players can unlock upgrades by accumulating carrots. These upgrades boost the rate at which carrots are generated, further increasing earning potential.

The introduction of carrots aims to create a continuous sense of achievement and excitement for players. It enables them to actively engage in the game, earning rewards and strategizing to increase their share of the treasure. This update is designed to keep players motivated and invested in the game's ecosystem.
