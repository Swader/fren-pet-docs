# Stake to Play (S2P)

FP is an incremental idle game, you can upgrade your Pet and land to unlock features, gain more pGOLD, and get a bigger share of the overall game ETH rewards. 

All FP used to upgrade is fully refunded via a Stake to Play model. All your spending is added to the contract and returned to you (per block) within 30 days.

For example if you use 30 $FP to upgrade your pet, you will be receiving back 1 $FP a day and by day 30 you'll have 30 FP total that you could have withdrawn. Note that accumulation and withdraws can be done at any time.

This why users can play safely knowing they can keep playing and upgrading for as long as they want to be part of the game.

# pGOLD Liquiidity providers

Due to the mechanics of pGOLD you can also stake your FP and earn pGOLD and fees. This guarantees you'll end up with more FP by the end. please read more about how pGOLD works -> here.
