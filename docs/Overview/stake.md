# Stake to Play (S2P)

Fren Pet is an incremental idle game. You can upgrade your Pet and land to unlock features, gain more pGOLD, and get a bigger share of the overall game ETH rewards. 

All $FP used for upgrades is fully refunded via a Stake to Play model. All your spending is added to the contract and returned to you (per block) within 30 days.

For example, if you use 30 $FP to upgrade your pet, you will be receiving back 1 $FP a day and by day 30 you'll have 30 $FP total that you could have withdrawn. Note that accumulation and withdrawals can be done at any time.

This is why users can play safely, knowing they can keep playing and upgrading for as long as they want to be part of the game.

# pGOLD Liquidity Providers

Due to the mechanics of pGOLD you can also stake your $FP and earn pGOLD and fees. This guarantees you'll end up with more $FP at the end. Please read more about how pGOLD works -> [here](docs/Overview/pgold.md).
