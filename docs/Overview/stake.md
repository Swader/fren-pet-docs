# Stake to Play (S2P)

FP is an incremental idle game, you can upgrade your Pet to unlock features, gain more pGOLD, and get a bigger share of the overall game ETH rewards. 

All FP used to upgrade your pet is fully refunded via a Stake2Play model. Your spending is added to the contract and returned to you (per block) within 30 days.

For example if you use 30 $FP to upgrade your pet with 1000 points, you will be receiving back 1 $FP a day, by day 30 you'll have 30 FP total that you could have withdrawn. You can withdraw on a per block basis.

# pGOLD Liquiidity providers


You can stake FP to help players cashout on their pGOLD. Due the entirety of pGOLD supply being backed by an ever growing FP treasury you are always expected to have more FP value when you unstake.

There is also a 2% swap fee when players buy or sell gold with FP.


This guarantees you'll end up with more FP by the end. please read more about how pGOLD works -> here.
