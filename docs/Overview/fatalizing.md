# Fatalizing Pets and Earning Stars

When a pet's TOD (time of death) reaches 0 you will see a skull by their name in the leaderboard, the first to click on the skull and send a tx will help burn the dead pet and will earn a star in return.

You can check how many stars you've gained in the achievements page.
