# Buying food and Time Of Death (TOD)

The premise of the game is to take care of your pet, on your pet page you will see different food options with scores and a timer of your "TOD" (Time Of Death). 

Time Of Death (TOD) is when your pet will die if it's not fed, if your pet dies your NFT is first sent to hibernation (read more below), after hibernation your pet will beburned you can't revivie it or use it again.

You buy food by paying in $FP Tokens.

Give your pet foods according to your stragegy and feeling, you can be agressive to raise in the leaderboard or just calm giving your pet an apple every 3 days.

**Note that your TOD (Time Of Death) never adds up, each new food you give your pet resets the TOD to that food's specific TOD properties**


# Hibernation

If you forget to feed your pet, other players can send it to hibernation and the get rewarded with a star, hibernation is a period of 7 days where you do not lose your points or items and can feed your pet again to return to the game.

### How it works

- While hibernating, if attacked by other players, the pet can lose 1% of its points (compared to 0.5% for active pets) and odds are 50-50 instead of 60-40. 
- Players have a 7-day window to feed their pet and bring it back to life. After that, pet can be killed by other players losing its score.
- To reactivate a hibernating pet, the first meal cost includes the regular price plus an additional 10 FP.
- If a pet dies after the 7-day hibernation period, owned shop items are automatically sold back to the shop. FP value and ETH rewards are transferred to the player's wallet.
